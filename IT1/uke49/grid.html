            <h1>1. London</h1>
            <p>London is one of the world's top tourist destinations, attracting upward of 15 million visitors each and every year.
                Britain's capital city is a vibrant arts and entertainment center (its theaters are always busy), and 50 years after
                the Beatles, the country's music scene still rocks.
                London also boasts one of the planet's greatest concentrations of cultural attractions. From royal palaces to
                the people's parliament, from Roman ruins to castles and cathedrals, you could spend endless days exploring
                London's sites without ever running out of unique things to see and do</p>

            <h1>2.Venezia</h1>
            <p>With a city as filled with tourist attractions as Venice, it's hard to know where to begin. Perhaps the best way
                is to simply get lost for a few hours wandering through its enchanting little streets and passageways, strolling
                beside its canals, and finding its secret corners. At every turn, you'll see something worth remembering with a
                photo. No matter where this exploration takes you, it's easy to find your way back to Piazza San Marco and the
                Grand Canal. Most of the best sights you'll want to visit lie around these two landmarks</p>

        <div class="five">
            <h1>3. Paris</h1>
            <p> As the capital city of France, Paris has endured as an important city for more than 2,000 years.
                Often called by nicknames like the “city of love” and “city of lights,” Paris is today one of the world’s
                leading centers for business, fashion, entertainment, art and culture. Just the mere mention of Paris conjures
                up images of the city’s world famous landmarks, museums and cathedrals.

                Also called the Capital of Fashion, Paris is home to some of the world’s finest designer names including
                Yves Saint-Laurent, Lancôme, L’Oréal and Christian Dior. The city’s shopping scene ranges from shopping
                centers to open-air markets, boutiques and flea markets.</p>

            <p>London is one of the world's top tourist destinations, attracting upward of 15 million visitors each and every year.
                Britain's capital city is a vibrant arts and entertainment center (its theaters are always busy), and 50 years after

            <h1>5. santorini</h1>
            <p> The island of Santorini (Thíra) is most impressive when approached from the sea as you sail into the
                massive caldera (sea-filled volcanic crater), almost totally enclosed by sheer cliffs ranging in height
                between 200 and 400 meters. Along the gray-black lava cliff tops, the whitewashed settlements of Firá and
                Oia are the island's most alluring (and most expensive) destinations. In fact, Santorini lives almost entirely
                from tourism, attracting visitors with its extraordinary landscape and its ancient archaeological sites.
                It is generally marketed as a romantic destination - popular with honeymooners, couples, and celebrities.
                Cruise ships sailing the East Mediterranean make a one-day port of call here.</p>
